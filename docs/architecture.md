# Architecture: OpenLongContext Document QA API

## Overview

The OpenLongContext Document QA API is a production-ready FastAPI service for uploading, indexing, and querying large documents using efficient long-context transformer models. It is designed for extensibility, reproducibility, and high performance.

## Components

- **FastAPI Application**: Exposes REST endpoints for document upload, query, and metadata retrieval.
- **Document Store**: In-memory (or pluggable persistent) storage for uploaded documents and metadata.
- **Model Inference Module**: Wraps efficient long-context models (e.g., BigBird, Longformer) for question answering and retrieval.
- **Testing Suite**: 100% coverage with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **CI/CD**: Automated with GitHub Actions, linting, type-checking, and coverage reporting.

```

## Extensibility

- Swap in any long-context model by implementing the `answer_question` interface in `openlongcontext/api/model_inference.py`.
- Replace in-memory store with persistent DB for production.
- Add authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring as needed.

## Security & Best Practices

- All endpoints are type-checked and validated.
- 100% test coverage and CI/CD.
- Designed for safe deployment in research and production environments.
