# Scaling Laws in Long-Context Models

## What Are Scaling Laws?

Scaling laws describe how model performance (accuracy, loss, etc.) changes as a function of key variables such as:
- Context length (number of tokens)
- Model size (parameters)
- Dataset size

Understanding these laws is critical for designing efficient, high-performing models for long-context tasks.

## Studying Scaling Laws with OpenLongContext

OpenLongContext provides all the tools needed to empirically study scaling laws:
- Modular configs for model size, context length, and data
- CLI and API for running controlled experiments
- Built-in scripts for analyzing results (see `examples/scaling_laws/`)

## Example Experiment

1. Define a set of configs varying context length (e.g., 2K, 8K, 32K, 128K tokens)
2. Train or evaluate models on each config using the CLI or API
3. Collect metrics (accuracy, loss, latency)
4. Plot results to observe scaling trends

## Interpreting Results

- Look for power-law or log-linear relationships
- Identify diminishing returns or bottlenecks
- Use findings to guide model and system design
